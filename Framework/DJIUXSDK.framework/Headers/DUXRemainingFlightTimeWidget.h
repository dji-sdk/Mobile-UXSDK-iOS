 *    to land aircraft immediately.

 *    return aircraft home.
 *    - Green part of the line represents the battery percentage left to fly safely.

 *    - The first one from the left represents the land immediately threshold.
 *    - The second one represents the go home threshold.

 *  battery percentage needed to go home.
