# DJI UX SDK for iOS

## What Is This?

The UX SDK is a suite of product agnostic UI objects that fast tracks the development of iOS applications using the [DJI Mobile SDK](http://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/).

## Get Started Immediately

### UX SDK Installation with CocoaPods

Since this project has been integrated with [DJI iOS UX SDK CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/DJI-UXSDK-iOS) now, please check the following steps to install **DJISDK.framework** using CocoaPods after you downloading this project:

**1.** Install CocoaPods

Open Terminal and change to the download project's directory, enter the following command to install it:

~~~
sudo gem install cocoapods
~~~

The process may take a long time, please wait. For further installation instructions, please check [this guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

**2.** Install UX SDK with CocoaPods in the Project

Run the following command in the **ObjcSampleCode** and **SwiftSampleCode** paths:

~~~
pod install
~~~

If you install it successfully, you should get the messages similar to the following:

~~~
Analyzing dependencies
Downloading dependencies
Installing DJI-SDK-iOS (4.7)
Installing DJI-UXSDK-iOS (4.7)
Generating Pods project
Integrating client project

[!] Please close any current Xcode sessions and use `UXSDKOCSample.xcworkspace` for this project from now on.
Pod installation complete! There is 1 dependency from the Podfile and 1 total pod
installed.
~~~

> **Note**: If you saw "Unable to satisfy the following requirements" issue during pod install, please run the following commands to update your pod repo and install the pod again:
>
> ~~~
> pod repo update
> pod install
> ~~~

### Run Sample Code

Developers will need to setup the App Key by editing the sample code's info.plist, [after generating their unique App Key](https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/quick-start/index.html#generate-an-app-key).

For the Objective-C sample app, the key value **DJISDKAppKey** should to be added to "Info.plist" with your unique app key as a string.  

For the Swift sample app, the **DJISDKAppKey** is present in the "Info.plist" - developers just need to add their unique key.
In both cases developers will still need to update the [Bundle Identifier](http://developer.dji.com/user/mobile-sdk/ios-configuration/) .

One of DJI's aircraft or handheld cameras will be required to run the sample application.  

### DJIWidget Integration

In iOS SDK 4.7, we have replaced the **VideoPreviewer** with **DJIWidget** for video decoding. Please be sure to integrate the contents of **DJIWidget** into your project if you are not using our sample code template or are upgrading to 4.7 for the first time. 

Follow the Build Phases settings of either sample code project in this repo for the best result. You must then remove the **VideoPreviewer** project if you were using it previously.
